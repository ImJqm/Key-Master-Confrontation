# Key-Master-Confrontation
Key-Keyhole Confrontation Master Key Puzzle is the full name

This is a simple game made in JavaScript with the CodeHS JavaScript Graphics Library. It is a student project so expect bugs. Other than that have fun. The goal of the game is to defeat the boss. This is achieved via picking up the keys and filling in the keyholes. As you progress the boss will gain more attacks, increasing the difficulty.
